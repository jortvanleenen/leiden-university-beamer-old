# leiden-university-beamer
A beamer theme that aims to closely mimic Leiden University's presentation slides as provided in their house style.

It is designed to easily integrate with Overleaf. This repository can be downloaded as .zip file and uploaded to Overleaf as new project. To get started, I recommended making the required changes to `example.tex`.
